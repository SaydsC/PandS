The purpose of thid PandS repository on Github is to hold my weekly task work as required for the Programming and Scripting module - lecturer Andrew Beatty

I have minimal previous programming experience other than use of maple and matlab in my previous studies.

Weekly Task 02: bmi.py
used datacamp lecture on variables, used variables height and weight and assigned values
later added if categorys for definig outcomes of bmi e.g. healthy, overweight
added round function to get BMI to decimal places from https://digitash.com/learntips/topic/coding-a-simple-python-bmi-calculator-using-functions/

Read in the text file
Store the contents as a variable per lab
Use Count method from a cheat sheet 
define an argument to state frequency of a letter required
Print the count of the letter

Weekly Task 08: plottask.py
first did basic x,y defined the functions f(x), g(x) and h(x), used lab to import numpy and matploblib
when had that plotted and defined the axes I used google to look for methods to improve appearance
hhtps://stackoverflow.com/questions/51891583/create-a-surface-plot-of-xyz-altitude-data-in-pyhton and to add labels and amend colours (turtlr)

Found vast difference in my understanding from beginning of the module and have become much more comfotable in my environment
